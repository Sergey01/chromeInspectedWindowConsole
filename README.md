# chromeInspectedWindowConsole
Little MV3 Chrome extension meant to play around with chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow API.

This extension currently loads as a tab in the Chrome Dev Tools section with the title of _"inspectWindow Console"_.

Functionality (and form) is currently limited and there is no _window_ object.
